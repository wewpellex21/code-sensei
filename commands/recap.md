4. Award +20 XP for completing the recap
   - Update profile with session data
   - Update streak
   - Check for belt promotion

5. If a belt promotion happens during recap, celebrate it!

6. Save the session to the profile's session history

## Tone

The recap should feel like a victory screen in a video game. The user just spent time building something AND learning — celebrate that. Even if they only learned one concept, that's one more than yesterday.

If the user had a long, productive session, really hype them up. If it was short, be encouraging that even small sessions add up.
